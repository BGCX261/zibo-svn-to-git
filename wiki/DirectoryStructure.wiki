== Installation Directory Structure ==

The directory structure of a Zibo installation looks like:

  * application
    * <package structure>
  * modules
    * module
      * <package structure>
    * module.phar
      * <package structure>
    * ...
  * system
    * <package structure>

  * application: everything for your application comes in this directory according to the package directory structure. The files in this directory will override the ones in modules or system.
  * modules: all extensions on the core, needed for your application, come in here. This can be a directory or a phar file with the package directory structure inside.
  * system: everything needed to get Zibo running will be in this directory according to the package directory structure.

== Package Directory Structure ==

The directory structure of your application, a module and the core should look like the following if applicable:

  * config: configuration files
  * data: data files needed by the implementation
  * l10n: localization files (translations)
  * log: log files (only in application)
  * public: files hosted directly by the webserver (only in application)
  * src: sources of the implementation
  * view: templates of the views
  * web: all files open to the world
